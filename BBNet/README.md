# BBNet

**BBNet** is a neural network emulator for **Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)**.  
It provides fast predictions of primordial abundances (e.g., $Y_p$, D/H) compared with traditional solvers such as **PArthENoPE (pe)** and **AlterBBN (al)**.  

This package includes two pretrained models:
- **Parthenope (pe)** mode ¡ú trained on data generated from PArthENoPE
- **AlterBBN (al)** mode ¡ú trained on data generated from AlterBBN
